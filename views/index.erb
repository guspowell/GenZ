      </h3>
      <p> Design and innovation consultancy Seymourpowell carried out a qualitative study to get under the skin of Gen Z,
        an extraordinary new generation. We spent time with influential members of Gen Z leading progressive lifestyles to
        illuminate the cultural shifts that they are creating, as the attitudes and behaviours they are forming today will
        influence the future consumer landscapes of tomorrow. These cards are a snap shot of our findings.

      <h2>EMBRACING EXTREMES<h2>
      <p>While Gen Z are highly appreciative of the global connectivity afforded to them since birth, they are now starting to recognise its downside. They feel they have less to discover than those who have gone before them. This ‘adventure deficit’ is pushing them to take on extreme challenges from an early age; whether that be by setting global records, or developing innovative new technologies. This points towards a future where flourishing brands will be those that can quench the consumer thirst for adventure.<p>

      <h2>HOLD ON TO THE PHYSICAL<h2>
      <p>While all things digital are deeply entwined with Gen Z behaviour, they are surprisingly sceptical about purely digital experiences and are not yet willing to completely let go of the physical world. This indicates that real-world experiences will continue to be sought out and enjoyed for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <h2>PRIVACY TIGHTROPE<h2>
      <p>Hype surrounding data privacy is proving to be a formative influence on Gen Z.

Expect Gen Z to be even more cautious over how their data is stored and used than any previous generation.</p>

      <h2>MARKETING WITH ETIQUETTE<h2>

However, emerging technology has meant that brands can now reach their target audience 24 hours a day, resulting in Gen Z feeling bombarded by brand messaging. In tomorrow’s consumer landscape, care will need to be taken to observe social etiquette, to ensure that messages are targeted and relevant rather than a personal invasion.</p>
